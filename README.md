### Features

* In this project the buttons flash and the user is to copy the sequence and click the correct button.
* I have a counter so the user knows what level they are on throughout the game.
* I have used a random function which will allow the game to use a unique sequence each time.

### Technologies Used

JQuery - I have used jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation
Bootsrap - I have used bootsrap for icons and effects
Font Awesome - I have used font awesome to add some different font onto my website.
CSS - For styling the game
HTML - For the elements of the game
